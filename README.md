# HMS-SpringBoot
Hospital Management System Developed using Spring boot

## User Medicine Management API
This Spring Boot RESTful API allows you to manage user information, medicine details, and visit history. The API saves user data such as name, age, and sex, along with medicine information, including the name and amount. It also tracks visit history by storing the date along with user and medicine details for that day. More modules will be added later.
